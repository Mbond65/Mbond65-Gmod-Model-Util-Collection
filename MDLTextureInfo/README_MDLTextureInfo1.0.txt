[Source MDL Texture Information v1.0]
==========================================================================
(c)2004 Neil "Jed" Jedrzejewski (jed@wunderboy.org) http:///www.wunderboy.org

[Info]
======

This is a quick console app that will tell you the textures used by a MDL
file from a game using the Vavle Source engine. It will list the textures
used by their VMT file plus the folders in which it the model will look
for the textures.

[Installation]
==============

Place MDLTextureInfo.exe in your Source_SDK\Bin folder.


[Instructions and Stuff]
========================

MDLTextureInfo needs to exist in the SourceSDK\Bin folder but doesn't need Steam
to be running to actually work (at the moment).

Create a shortcut to it, or use it via the command line. Either drag and drop
a MDL file onto the shortcut you created or type MDLTextureInfo.exe followed by
the path and filename to your MDL file.

[Known Bugs]
============

* Will crap out if you drop a non MDL file onto it (if you do that, your either
  plain stupid or an eternal optimist).
